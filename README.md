# UFOs

## Overview

Dana is a data journalist and did a piece integrating information on her hometown and UFO sightings.  She requested a html page to display her article and the data she's gathered on UFO sightings.

Using JavaScript, the app.js file pulls the data from the original data.js list to build the table and allow for filtering by date, city, state, country, and shape. The index.html file can build the page and run the filtering code through linking the app.js file, while the style.css provides a bit of polish to the page to create a more professional look fit for a journalist.

## Results

The filtering feature allows for a much more precise list that any visitor to the site may want.  For example, instead of just looking by date, one could look by city like the picture listed below:

/picture/

Just type in the various filters (any or all) that one would like to narrow the data down by and click enter.  You'll see the table will filter down to only list the data fitting those parameters.  If they want to reset the table, just click "UFO Sightings" at the top of the page.

With very little editing, the .js and .html files can be used for various datasets that may be received upon further research if the client wishes to display multiple tables or update the data.js to add to the existing table.

## Summary

The site is a great display for the client's article and corresponding data.  Unfortunately, it wasn't requested to create parameters for the Duration column or a key word search in the Comments column, so filtering is still limited to some degree.  

In addition, removing the button in the filter search, it could also take away the confidence of the user.  It's not necessarily intuitive to enter the criteria and clicking Enter on a keyboard as so many sites have a "search" button and Dana is hoping for a broad range of viewers, so inclusivity of all readers should be considered.  I'd recommend either including short instructions or adding the button back into the filter search section of the site.

Finally, while the layout and aesthetic updates make for a visually intriguing page, there is still room for improvement.  the title section of the article leaves a lot of "white space" as the article itself is much longer.  I would recommend either adding a script to hide anything more than the first two lines of the article with a "read more" link to unhide the rest or use the blank section under the article header. A picture, a contact section (which she asks readers to do at the end of her article), or possibly a ticker update for UFO sightings reported within the last 24 hours could be included to fill the space.

Even without any further developments, I believe the requested product was delivered and Dana now has a great starter code for any further web pages she may want to develop and deploy.
